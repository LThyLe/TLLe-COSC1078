  <p style="color:white;"> Having only read the first line, most of you would have PTSD from re-writing this phrase multiple times if you had the pleasure of learning how to program. That stated, a self-introduction is needed! My name is Thy, but I prefer to be called Lisa with Le being my surname. I’m currently a first-year student at RMIT studying for a bachelor’s in information technology. My nationality is Australian, but with a Vietnamese ethnic background. I do tend to speak Vietnamese at home but when I’m out, it’s English … ha-ha! An interesting fact about me, is that I like to colour my hair. Right now, it’s currently blue / green but I would like to go back to purple. I’m aware that it makes me stand out, but I love it. I’m also 1 out of 6 children, the 3rd to be specific and one out of 5 girls, meaning I only have 1 brother.

  <h2 style="color:Black;">Interest in IT </h2>
  <p style="color:white;">Interest in IT
My interest in IT started back in primary school, when my dad wanted to teach my siblings and I how to create a website using HTML and java.  I was aware of that interest throughout my school years however never acted on it until starting this degree. When studying my first degree, I did touch on a couple units revolving around information technology which sparked my interest again, thus further pushing me to start learning and eventually falling into this degree.
What I find interesting in IT, is how they incorporate a lot of factors into creating things. It could be small or big. The concept of how we need data access to create input through to designing ways on how to program things into responding back to you and further the overall aspect of being connected to everything and is continuously updating every day.
Honestly, I chose RMIT to study at due to hearing good reviews from friends and family. A driving factor would also be that it has Information Technology in the name, not to mention its within the CBD! Making the whole aspect of uni attractive as its in a bustling area and the thought to just eating out with friends after class is a bonus.
I expect to gain at least some basic knowledge in the key concepts on how IT affects everything. E.g., how people come up with the interface of their product or services, through to the in depths programs written for their apps and how they try to avoid takeovers or fix any issues or bugs that may appear through system updates or security breaches and so forth.
